# DoggoGo

Run with `python3 server.py`

Use `--init` first time you run the server and every time you want to reset the database and remove saved images.

DoggoGo is a web app that allows users to upload dog pictures and identifies their breed, using machine learning. It features a leaderboard for the most active users and a gallery of most recent dogs uploaded.

We used Python (Flask for the web app, Tensorflow for the ML algorithm), HTML, CSS and some SQL.
